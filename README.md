# PROMISE-tanitaBC418
Validation of Tanita BC-418 using data collected from the PROMISE cohort.

The project will focus on comparing whole body and segmental fat mass measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) using the Tanita BC-418 with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements made using the Hologic Discovery A. A subset of the data obtained from the longitudinal PROspective Metabolism and ISlet cell Evaluation (PROMISE) study will be used.

Potential future directions include:
* Comparing muscle mass / fat free mass
* Examining metabolic syndrome markers
